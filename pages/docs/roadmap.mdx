# Hellō Roadmap

Below are some of the new features and functionality we are exploring to work on next (or have completed). 


## Quickstarts / SDKs

As noted on [Quickstarts](./quickstarts), we are planning on Quickstarts and SDKs for:
- Nuxt
- Remix
- SvelteKit

[Let us know what else you would like to see.](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello.dev/discussions/53)

## Delegated Access

Users will be able to delegate access to certain apps to other users.

## Emergency Override

Users will be able to select two or more users that can mutually agree to "break glass" on a user's account if they are somehow incapacitated. 

## B2B Federation

This functionality will allow a B2B app to offer their enterprise customers SSO and directory sync using their existing Hellō integration. We will introduce claims for `org` and `groups` that can be requested by an app. Hellō will federate with Enterprises, allowing them to re-use the federation across all Hellō apps. Users will be able to select from their personal or work identities on who they want to be when logging into an app.

## Hellō User Discovery

This functionality will let applications discover if a user has a Hellō Wallet, enabling the application to only offer Hellō to users that already have a Hellō Wallet, and continue offering the existing registration and log in to other users.


## Shipped

### Mock Server

A headless mock service and a Docker image that would return test user info or errors for end-to-end automated development testing.

[Mockin Docs](/docs/mockin/), npm package [@hellocoop/mockin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/mockin), dockerimage [hellocoop/mockin](https://hub.docker.com/r/hellocoop/mockin), and [mockin source](https://github.com/hellocoop/mockin).

### App Invitations

A Web App that you send your users to for them to invite other users to your app.

Now available in [Hellō Developer Console](https://console.hello.coop) and available for your applications in BETA. See the [Invite](/docs/apis/invite/) documentation for details.
