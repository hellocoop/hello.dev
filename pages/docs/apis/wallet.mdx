# Wallet

## Authorization Request 

See [OpenID Connect | Auth Request](../oidc/request/) for the supported standard parameters.

The Hell≈ç Wallet supports the following extended parameter:

### `provider_hint`

When Hell≈ç does not know the user's preferred provider (new user or new browser), they are presented with a recommended list of providers to choose from, with the option to show all the other supported providers. This minimizes the risk that a new user is overwhelmed by all the available options, while still providing choice.

You can change which providers are recommended to better align with your users' preferences by passing a `provider_hint` query parameter in your authorization request.  You add providers by providing one or more space (or `+` in URL) separated slugs: 

```http {3}
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=discord+github
```

You can demote a default provider by suffixing the slug with `--`.

```http /google--/
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=google--
```

**Provider Defaults** 

| Platform     | Default provider_hint values  |
| -----------  | ----------------------------- |

## Authorization Response

See [OpenID Connect | Auth Response](../oidc/response/) for the supported standard parameters.

The Hell≈ç Wallet supports the following extended parameter:

### `wildcard_domain`

This parameter is part of the Hell≈ç Auto Config process. If wildcard Development Redirect URIs (`https://*`) are enabled, and the supplied `redirect_uri` is not registered,
then the Wallet will append the `wildcard_domain` parameter to the authorization response so that the application software can detect that it's Redirect URI is not registered, and prompt the developer to register it.
