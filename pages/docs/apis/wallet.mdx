# Wallet API

## Authorization Request 

See [OpenID Connect | Auth Request](../oidc/request/) for the supported standard parameters.

The Hell≈ç Wallet supports the following extended parameters:

### `provider_hint`

When Hell≈ç does not know the user's preferred provider (new user or new browser), they are presented with a recommended list of providers to choose from, with the option to show all the other supported providers. This minimizes the risk that a new user is overwhelmed by all the available options, while still providing choice.

You can change which providers are recommended to better align with your users' preferences by passing a `provider_hint` query parameter in your authorization request.  You add providers by providing one or more space (or `+` in URL) separated slugs: 

```http {3}
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=discord+github
```

You can demote a default provider by suffixing the slug with `--`.

```http /google--/
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=google--
```

**Provider Defaults** 

| Platform     | Default provider_hint values  |
| -----------  | ----------------------------- |
| Default      | `google email`                |
| macOS/iOS    | `apple google email`          |
| Windows      | `microsoft google email`      |

Possible slug values:

- `apple`
- `apple--`
- `discord`
- `email`
- `email--`
- `ethereum`
- `facebook`
- `github`
- `gitlab`
- `google`

### `domain_hint`

The `domain_hint` indicates which domain, or type of account you want from the user. 

If you provide a domain such as `hello.coop`, then the user will 
be directed to log in with the provider that manages `hello.coop`.

If you pass `domain_hint=managed`, then the user will be prompted to select a managed account. You can set this value if you want to require a managed account for your app.

If you pass `domain_hint=personal`, then the user will be prompted to select a personal account. You can set this value if you want to require a personal account for your app.


## Authorization Response

See [OpenID Connect | Auth Response](../oidc/response/) for the supported standard parameters.

The Hell≈ç Wallet supports the following extended parameters:

### `wildcard_domain`

This parameter is part of the Hell≈ç Auto Config process. If wildcard Development Redirect URIs (`https://*`) are enabled, and the supplied `redirect_uri` is not registered,
then the Wallet will append the `wildcard_domain` parameter to the authorization response so that the application software can detect that it's Redirect URI is not registered, and prompt the developer to register it. The `wildcard_domain` is a URL that will load the Hell≈ç Developer Console for the current Application and prompt the team member to save as a Development Redirect URI, Production Redirect URI, or cancel

### `app_name`

Included if `wildcard_domain` is provided. Contains the App Name as registered at the Hell≈ç Developer Console.
