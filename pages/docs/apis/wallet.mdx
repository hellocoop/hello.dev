# Wallet

## Authorization Request 

See [OpenID Connect | Auth Request](../oidc/request/) for the supported standard parameters.

The Hellō Wallet supports the following extended paramters:

### `provider_hint`

When Hellō does not know the user's preferred provider (new user or new browser), they are presented with a recommended list of providers to choose from, with the option to show all the other supported providers. This minimizes the risk that a new user is overwhelmed by all the available options, while still providing choice.

You can change which providers are recommended to better align with your users' preferences by passing a `provider_hint` query parameter in your authorization request.  You add providers by providing one or more space (or `+` in URL) separated slugs: 

```http {3}
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=discord+github
```

You can demote a default provider by suffixing the slug with `--`.

```http /google--/
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=google--
```

**Provider Defaults** 

| Platform     | Default provider_hint values  |
| -----------  | ----------------------------- |
| Default      | `google email passkey¹`       |
| macOS/iOS    | `apple google email passkey¹` |
| Windows      | `microsoft google email`      |

¹ Mobile devices where passkey is supported

**Possible slug values**

`apple google discord facebook github gitlab`<br/>
` twitch twitter tumblr mastodon microsoft line qrcode wordpress yahoo `<br/>
`email ethereum passkey`
