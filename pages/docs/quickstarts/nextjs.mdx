# Next.js


## Next.js Starter

The [Hellō Next.js Starter](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello-nextjs-starter) demonstrates how to use the [`@hellocoop/nextjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/nextjs) package. 
In less than a minute you will have the starter app running on your local machine -- a minute later you can have it deployed to Vercel. 
You will have access to all the Hellō login options including Apple, Facebook, Google, GitHub, GitLab, and Microsoft. See deployed versions at [https://hello-nextjs-starter.vercel.app/](https://hello-nextjs-starter.vercel.app/) and [https://hello-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/](https://hello-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/).
