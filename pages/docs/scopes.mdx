# Hellō Scopes

## Overview

You request claims from Hellō by including a scope for that claim in your request. Any claims you request from Hellō are required claims, IE the user will need to provide a value. Hellō only supports verified email and phone claims. Unverified email and phone are not supported. See below fora full list of supported scopes and associated claims. 

Hellō will always return the `sub` claim, a globally unique identifier in the form of a GUID, that you can use to identify the user across any apps under your publisher. The `sub` claim is unique to your publisher for a given user. Other publishers will receive a different `sub` claim for the user.

Note that it is best practice to only request the claims you require. For example, you may only need a preferred name to address the user initially, and a verified email address when they would like a notification. Hellō makes it easy to do incremental consent and request additional claims once you need them.


You include scopes in the request for the information (claims) you would like Hellō to return about the user. Unlike other providers, Hellō will always provide a value for any requested scope. Hellō will always gather user consent before releasing information to you. 

When requesting multiple scopes, separate them with a space. The space will often be converted to a `+` when URL Encoding the parameters.

## Profile Update
You can update a claim a user has already provided you by creating a request including the `open_id` and`profile_update` claims with the scope for the claim the user would like to update an authorization request.
The `profile_update` scope can be utilized under the following conditions:
- You can only update a claim you have already received
- You can only update `email`, `phone`, `picture`, `discord`, `github`, `gitlab`, `twitter` or `ethereum`

For instance, to enable a user to update their email, you would set `scope=openid email profile_update` in your authorization request.

## Other Scopes?

If you would like us to offer other scopes, let us know in our [Additional Scopes Discussion](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello.dev/discussions/4)

## Incremental Consent

Per the [2nd Law of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352), Minimal Disclosure, we recommend you not request claims that are not required until they are needed. Hellō makes it easy to send the user back to Hellō to acquire additional claims by including additional scopes in a new request.
