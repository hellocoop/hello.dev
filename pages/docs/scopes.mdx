# Hell≈ç Scopes

Explore what claims each requested scope returns with the [Hell≈ç Playgound](https://playground.hello.dev)
</Callout>

## Overview

You request claims from Hell≈ç by including a scope for that claim in your request. Any claims you request from Hell≈ç are required claims, IE the user will need to provide a value. Hell≈ç only supports email and phone claims that have been verified. Unverified email and phone are not supported. See below for a full list of supported scopes and associated claims. 

Hell≈ç will always return the `sub` claim, a globally unique identifier in the form of a GUID, that you can use to identify the user across any apps under your publisher. The `sub` claim is unique to your publisher for a given user. Other publishers will receive a different `sub` claim for the user.

Note that it is best practice to only request the claims you require. For example, you may only need a preferred name to address the user initially, and a verified email address when they would like a notification. Hell≈ç makes it easy to do incremental consent and request additional claims once you need them.


You include scopes in the request for the information (claims) you would like Hell≈ç to return about the user. Unlike other providers, Hell≈ç will always provide a value for any requested scope. Hell≈ç will always gather user consent before releasing information to you. 

When requesting multiple scopes, separate them with a space. The space will often be converted to a `+` when URL Encoding the parameters.


## Current Scopes

Following are the scopes currently supported by Hell≈ç. At the top are the standard OpenID Connect scopes supported by Hell≈ç.

|Scope|Description|
|---|---|
|`openid`|This scope is required, and the `sub` claims is always returned.<br/>If you don't want any other claims, provide just this one.|
|`name`|Full / legal name.|
|`nickname`|Preferred name.|
|`given_name`|AKA First name.|
|`family_name`|AKA Last name.|
|`email`|A verified email address. `email_verified=true` will always be returned.|
|`phone`|A verified phone number. `phone_verified=true` will always be returned.|
|`picture`|A URL to a profile picture. [See FAQ 13](/faqs/#13-what-can-i-do-with-the-picture-url-i-receive) for details|
|`profile`|equivalent to `name`, `email`, and `picture`|

|Hell≈ç Scopes|Description|
|---|---|
|`discord`|A verified Discord username and id.|
|`github`|A verified GitHub username and id.|
|`gitlab`|A verified GitLab username and id.|
|`twitter`|A verified Twitter username and id.|
|`ethereum`|A verified ethereum address.|

If the user has already provided consent to your application, they will not be prompted again to consent to the claims provided unless you include `prompt=consent` in your authorization request. This allows the user to update the profile data that they have provided you. To provide a better experience for your users with `prompt=consent`, also include `login_hint=name@domain.example`.


## Other Scopes?

If you would like us to offer other scopes, let us know in our [Additional Scopes Discussion](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello.dev/discussions/4)

## Incremental Consent

Per the [2nd Law of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352), Minimal Disclosure, we recommend you not request claims that are not required until they are needed. Hell≈ç makes it easy to send the user back to Hell≈ç to acquire additional claims by including additional scopes in a new request.
