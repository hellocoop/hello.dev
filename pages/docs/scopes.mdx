## Overview

You request claims from Hell≈ç by including a scope for that claim in your request. Any claims you request from Hell≈ç are required claims, IE the user will need to provide a value. Hell≈ç only supports verified email and phone claims. Unverified email and phone are not supported. See below fora full list of supported scopes and associated claims. 

Hell≈ç will always return the `sub` claim, a globally unique identifier in the form of a GUID, that you can use to identify the user across any apps under your publisher. The `sub` claim is unique to your publisher for a given user. Other publishers will receive a different `sub` claim for the user.

Note that it is best practice to only request the claims you require. For example, you may only need a preferred name to address the user initially, and a verified email address when they would like a notification. Hell≈ç makes it easy to do incremental consent and request additional claims once you need them.


You include scopes in the request for the information (claims) you would like Hell≈ç to return about the user. Unlike other providers, Hell≈ç will always provide a value for any requested scope. Hell≈ç will always gather user consent before releasing information to you. 

When requesting multiple scopes, separate them with a space. The space will often be converted to a `+` when URL Encoding the parameters.

## Profile Update
You can update a claim a user has already provided you by creating a request including the `open_id` and`profile_update` claims with the scope for the claim the user would like to update an authorization request.
The `profile_update` scope can be utilized under the following conditions:
- You can only update a claim you have already received
- You can only update `email`, `phone`, `picture`, `discord`, `github`, `gitlab`, `twitter` or `ethereum`

For instance, to enable a user to update their email, you would set `scope=openid email profile_update` in your authorization request.


## Other Scopes?

If you would like us to offer other scopes, let us know in our [Additional Scopes Discussion](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello.dev/discussions/4)

## Incremental Consent

Per the [2nd Law of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352), Minimal Disclosure, we recommend you not request claims that are not required until they are needed. Hell≈ç makes it easy to send the user back to Hell≈ç to acquire additional claims by including additional scopes in a new request.
