# Authentication Request

Hellō supports both the [Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) and the [Implicit Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth)

## Create Request URL

*The [`@hellocoop/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/nextjs) npm package has a `createAuthRequest()` function that simplifies creating an authorization request URL, including the PKCE code_verifier and code_challenge*

The **request URL** is `https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize` and a query with the following standard [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) parameters:

### OpenID Connect Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|---|---|
|`client_id`<br/>*required*|The `client_id` for your app from [console.hello.coop](https://console.hello.coop).|
|`redirect_uri`<br/>*required*|One of the redirect_uri values you registered for your app.|
|`scope`<br/>*required*|The `openid` scope and zero or more space delimited scopes listed at [Hellō Claims](/docs/scopes).|
|`nonce`<br/>*required*|A unique string that will be included in the signed ID Token. This links the ID Token to your request.|
|`response_type`<br/>*optional*| `id_token` for *implicit flow* <br/>or<br/><span>`code` for *code flow* - default and recommended, but requires [PKCE - RFC7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html)).</span> |
|`response_mode`<br/>*optional*|if *id_token flow* can be `fragment` or `form_post` (default) <br/>if *code flow* can be `fragment`, `form_post`, or `query` (default).|
|`state`<br/>*optional*|A value representing the state of your application that will be returned as a parameter in the response.|
|`code_challenge`|REQUIRED if *code flow* and not using a client secret to authenticate to the token endpoint. See PKCE below.|
|`code_challenge_method`|MAY be provided if `code_challenge` is included.<br/>MUST have value of `S256` if included. See PKCE below.|
|`login_hint`<br/>*optional*|A hint for which user account to use. <br/>`login_hint=name@domain.example`|
|`prompt`<br/>*optional*|A space delimited list. Accepted values include:|
|                   | - `login` will require the user to re-authenticate at their login provider|
|                   | - `consent` will require the user to review, and potentially change, released claims|

### Hellō Parameters

|Hellō Parameters|Description|
|---|---|
|`provider_hint`<br/>*optional*| See [Wallet API \| provider_hint](/docs/apis/wallet/#provider_hint) for details. |
|`domain_hint`<br/>*optional*|A hint for which domain or type of account: |
| | - `domain.example` to request the user logs in with a specific managed account |
| | - `managed` to request a managed account |
| | - `personal` to request a personal (non-managed) account |


### PKCE Code

> [RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) *(Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients)* enables your application to prove it made the authorization request that received the authorization code when it calls the token endpoint. 
>
>
> This is done by generating a random `code_verifier` and then a `code_challenge` which is a SHA256 cryptographic hash `code_verifier`.
>
>
>The `code_challenge` is part of the authorization request, and the `code_verifier` is presented with the `code` to Hellō which verifies the `code` was requested with the `code_challenge`. This allows an application to not have to manage a client secret when using a `code` flow.


**Here is a sample `id_token` (implicit flow) request from the[ GreenfieldDemo](https://greenfielddemo.com) app**<br/>
*(line feeds added for readability)*

```http
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?client_id=3574f001-0874-4b20-bffd-8f3e37634274
&redirect_uri=https://greenfielddemo.com/
&scope=name+nickname+email+picture+openid
&nonce=b957cea0-f159-4390-ba48-5c5d7e943ea4
&response_mode=fragment
```

**Here is a sample `code` flow request from the [Hellō Next.js Sample](https://hello-nextjs-sample.vercel.app/) app**<br/>
*(line feeds added for readability)*

```http
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?client_id=db4ad0b8-c589-4328-8094-f2d0e2cd3aaa
&redirect_uri=https://hello-nextjs-sample.netlify.app/api/hellocoop
&scope=openid+name+email+picture
&nonce=ecc855c9-41e3-46a0-a99a-d1fa3e3c1d3f
&response_type=code
&response_mode=query
&code_challenge=F_xW4_XNddm_XXZgMQAnHBWZRAtc3ZXxb-kcL_rvDns
&code_challenge_method=S256
```

## Make Request

Cause the user's browser to load the `request URL` you created in `Step 2`. Here are some examples:
- Set `window.location.href` with JavaScript
```javascript
window.location.href = "https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize?..."
```
- An `<a>` tag with an `href` to the `requestURL`
```html
<a href="https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize?..." /> ... </a>
```
- HTTP 302 redirect from the server
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize?...
```

The user will then interact with Hellō. When finished they will be redirected back to your application with either an ID Token, an authorization code, or an error response.
