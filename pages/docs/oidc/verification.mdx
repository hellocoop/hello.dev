# ID Token Verification

## Introspection

Hellō provides an introspection API per [RFC 7662](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7662.html) at `https://wallet.hello.coop/oauth/introspect` that will examine the token, ensure it was from Hellō, has not expired, and return the payload.

### Request

No authentication is required to call the introspection endpoint. You MUST pass your `client_id`, and if you provided a `nonce` in the `request URL`, you MUST provide the nonce. The `token`, `client_id`, and optional `nonce` are sent as JSON.


NOTE: This is a stateless endpoint. This endpoint verifies the ID Token and returns the contents.


**Sample code to make Introspection API call**

```javascript
const url = 'https://wallet.hello.coop/oauth/introspect'
const params = {
  token,        // the ID Token received
  client_id,    // your apps client_id
  nonce,        // the nonce sent in the request
}
const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    mode: 'cors',
    cache: 'no-cache',
    headers: {'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    body: new URLSearchParams(params).toString()
}
const response = await fetch(url, options)
const json = await response.json()
```

### Response

If successfully verified, you will receive the ID Token payload with `active:true` to indicate it is an active token. If unsuccessful, you will receive an [Introspection Error](/docs/oidc/errors).

**Sample Introspection Response**

```json {21}
{
  "iss": "https://issuer.hello.coop",
  "aud": "3574f001-0874-4b20-bffd-8f3e37634274",
  "nonce": "b957cea0-f159-4390-ba48-5c5d7e943ea4",
  "jti": "8ad167d1-d170-46c9-b3c6-47dda735a4e3",
  "sub": "f9e21f0f-9f0e-41b0-a58b-c2d63bcc7b4f",
  "scope": [
      "name",
      "nickname",
      "picture",
      "email",
      "openid"
  ],
  "name": "Dick Hardt",
  "nickname": "Dick",
  "picture": "https://cdn.hello.coop/images/default-picture.png",
  "email": "dick.hardt@hello.coop",
  "email_verified": true,
  "iat": 1669399110,
  "exp": 1669399410,
  "active": true
}
```

Note the response is an ID Token with the additional claim `active: true` as highlighted.

## Self Verification

There are many OpenID Connect and JSON Web Token libraries that include ID Token validation. The OpenID Foundation maintains a list [here](https://openid.net/developers/libraries/). Getting security right is HARD. We recommend you use a proven library and NOT write your own validation. We include the information below for reference.

### Signature Verification Keys

Hellō provides OpenId Provider configuration information per [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) at:

[`https://issuer.hello.coop/.well-known/openid-configuration`](https://issuer.hello.coop/.well-known/openid-configuration)

The `jwks_uri` property in the configuration file contains the URI for a JSON file containing the public keys in JSON Web Key format ([RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517)) for verifying the signature per step (6) above.

### ID Token Verification Steps

Following are details for each ID Token verification step per [OpenID Connect 3.1.3.7](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation)

1. N/A - The ID Token is not encrypted
1. The `iss` value MUST be `https://issuer.hello.coop`
1. The `aud` value MUST be the `client_id` value provided in the request
1. N/A - The ID Token will not contain multiple audiences
1. There will not be an `azp` claim
1. The ID Token is signed per JWS. The certificates are XXX
1. The `alg` value will be `RS256`
1. N/A - the `alg` is always `RS256`
1. The current time must be before `exp`. Note the time is seconds since the Epoch, not milliseconds. ID Tokens expire after one hour.
1. The `iat` may be used by the client if the one hour expiry is longer than is desirable by the client.
1. The `nonce` is included if provided in the request.
1. The `acr` Claim is not supported at this time.
1. The `auth_time` Claim is not supported at this time.
