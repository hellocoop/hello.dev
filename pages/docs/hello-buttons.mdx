Clearly indicate when buttons are in a loading state with a spinner for a user-friendly experience.

## Tooltip

Include the Hellō JavaScript file in addition to the Hellō stylesheet for displaying the Hellō about text in the `<head>` of your document. 

```html {4}
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <link href="https://cdn.hello.coop/css/hello-btn.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
  <script src="https://cdn.hello.coop/js/hello-btn.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Creating your own

If you are concerned with including a script from Hellō, you can find the source code at [hellocoop/button](https://github.com/hellocoop/button). You can use this as a reference to create your own buttons.  

If you don't want to use the Hellō stylesheet, the Hellō button is either charcoal (#303030) on white, or white on charcoal. Note that the Hellō logo ō is an o with a macron. You can use the ō character if you have `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in your page `<head>` element (best practice for HTML documents). For reference, the UTF-8 encoding is `0xC5` `0x8D` and the HTML markup is `&omacr;`.
