   ```

2. **Create an application**:
   ```
   Use hello_manage_app with:
   - action: "create"
   - name: "My App"
   - dev_redirect_uris: ["http://localhost:3000/callback"]
   ```

## Authentication

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 for secure authentication:

1. **OAuth Flow**: When you first use the tool, the server opens your browser
2. **Login**: Complete the login process with your Hellō account
3. **Token**: The server receives a 1-hour access token
4. **Context**: All API calls return your complete developer context

- **Hellō Logo Design Guidance** - Guide for creating theme-appropriate logos
- **Hellō Login Button Implementation** - Complete button implementation guide

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication required" errors:**
- The server will automatically prompt for login when needed
- Make sure you complete the browser-based OAuth flow

**"Application not found" errors:**
- Use `hello_manage_app` with `action: "read"` to see your applications
- Make sure you're using the correct `client_id`

**Logo upload issues:**
- Ensure `logo_content_type` matches your image format
- Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, APNG, SVG
- Keep file sizes under 100KB for best performance
