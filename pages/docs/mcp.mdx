## Authentication

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 for secure authentication:

1. **OAuth Flow**: When you first use the tool, the server opens your browser
2. **Login**: Complete the login process with your Hell≈ç account
3. **Token**: The server receives a 1-hour access token
4. **Context**: All API calls return your complete developer context

- **Hell≈ç Quickstarts** - Framework-specific setup guides
- **Hell≈ç Logo Design Guidance** - Guide for creating theme-appropriate logos
- **Hell≈ç Login Button Implementation** - Complete button implementation guide

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication required" errors:**
- The server will automatically prompt for login when needed
- Make sure you complete the browser-based OAuth flow

**"Application not found" errors:**
- Use `hello_manage_app` with `action: "read"` to see your applications
- Make sure you're using the correct `client_id`

**Logo upload issues:**
- Ensure `logo_content_type` matches your image format
- Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, APNG, SVG
- Keep file sizes under 100KB for best performance

## Security & Limitations

**Security:**
- OAuth 2.1 industry-standard authentication
- Short-lived tokens (1-hour expiration)
- HTTPS-only API communication
- Access scoped to create, read, update. No deletion permitted.

**Current Limitations:**
- Cannot delete applications (use [Hell≈ç Console](https://console.hello.coop) for deletion)
- Token requires re-authentication after 1 hour of inactivity
