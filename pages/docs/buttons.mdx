</head>

Enhance user experience by adding interactive hover effects to your buttons.

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.hello-btn-hover-glow` | Subtle glowing effect on hover         |
| `.hello-btn-hover-flare`| Captivating flare effect when hovered over |
| `.hello-btn-hover-none` | No hover effect applied                        |

Clearly indicate when buttons are in a loading state with a spinner for a user-friendly experience.

| Button state classes    | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.hello-btn-loader`     | Adds a loading spinner respecting button style and hover classes         |

## Tooltip

To display a tooltip alongside the button and educate your users about Hellō, include the Hellō JavaScript file in addition to the Hellō stylesheet within the document's `<head>` section. You can see the button and tooltip combination in action at [GreenfieldDemo](https://greenfielddemo.com/).

```html {4, 7-10}
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <link href="https://cdn.hello.coop/css/hello-btn.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
  <script src="https://cdn.hello.coop/js/hello-btn.js"></script>
</head>

<div class="hello-container">
  <button class="hello-btn"></button>
  <button class="hello-about"></button>
</div>
```

The script automatically adds the "ō Continue with Hellō" text to the button. If you wish to override this behavior, such as changing the button label to "ō Update Email with Hellō," you can do so with the `data-label` attribute.

```html /data-label/
<div class="hello-container">
  <button class="hello-btn" data-label="ō&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Update Email with Hellō"></button>
  <button class="hello-about"></button>
</div>
```

If you want to use the script but do not want the tooltip, you can simply omit adding the  
`<button class="hello-about"></button>`.

## Locales

By default, the Hellō script localizes the button text according to the browser's language settings (`window.navigator.language`) if the [locale is supported](https://github.com/hellocoop/wallet-i18n). However, you can override this behavior using the `lang` attribute:

```html /lang/
<div class="hello-container" lang="de">
  <button class="hello-btn"></button>
  <button class="hello-about"></button>
</div>
```

## Creating your own

If you are concerned with including a script from Hellō, you can find the source code at [hellocoop/wallet-i18n](https://github.com/hellocoop/button), which also has the source for the Hellō stylesheet. You can use this as a reference to create your own buttons.

If you don't want to use the Hellō stylesheet, the Hellō button is either charcoal (`#303030`) on white, or white on charcoal. Note that the Hellō logo ō is an o with a macron. You can use the ō character if you have `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in your page `<head>` element (best practice for HTML documents). For reference, the UTF-8 encoding is `0xC5` `0x8D` and the HTML markup is `&omacr;`.
