# Environment Variables

Consult your deployment and framework documentation on how to set these the environment values.

## Required

### HELLO_COOKIE_SECRET

This environment variable must be set. It should be a different value for each environment such as development and production. This is the key to encrypt and decrypt the cookies. It is a 32 byte random / 64 character hex value. You can generate a value with:

```sh
node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Optional

### HELLO_REDIRECT_URI

Overrides auto config of `redirect_uri`. Set to be the full URL for the `redirect_uri` value. Setting this environment variable in production will eliminate the initial discovery bounce of auto config. 

## Advanced

### HELLO_CLIENT_ID

Will override the `client_id` value set in `hello.config.js`. Use if you need different `client_id` values for different environments.

### HELLO_API_ROUTE

Defaults to `/api/hellocoop`. Change if you MUST have a different path for the Hellō router.

### HELLO_HOST

Defaults to `wallet.hello.coop`. Change when using a mock server of the Wallet. 

### HELLO_DOMAIN

Defaults to `hello.coop`. Used by Hellō for development and internal testing. Will change the domain used for the Wallet, Quickstart, and Console.
