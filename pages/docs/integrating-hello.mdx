# Integrating Hellō

Now that you have registered your application at Hellō and added the button to your page, let's complete the integration. 

1. Connect the button click to creating a Request URL
2. Create a Request URL
3. Make the request by redirecting the user's browser to the Request URL
4. Receive the response
5. Process the response
6. Process the ID Token

At this point, you know which user you are interacting with, and have any of the claims you requested that the user consented to releasing to you.

All of the details in this document are standard [OAuth 2.0]() and [OpenID Connect 1.0](). We provide a complete guide here so that you have a single reference. 

There are many libraries that will abstract away the details. 

## 1. Respond to Button Click

The user clicks the button, we disable and show a loader, and get the request URL

### Client side redirection
```html
<button onclick="login(event)" class="hello-btn hello-btn-black-on-light"></button>

<script>
  async function login(event){
    event.target.classList.add('hello-btn-loader') // Show spinner
    event.target.disabled = true // Disable button
    const requestURL = await fetch()  // Fetch the request URL from your backend
    window.location.href = requestURL // See next step for creating request URL
  }
</script>
```
### Server side redirection

```html
<button onclick="login(event)" class="hello-btn hello-btn-black-on-light"></button>

<script>
  async function login(event){
    event.target.classList.add('hello-btn-loader') // Show spinner
    event.target.disabled = true // Disable button
    window.location.href = LOGIN_ENDPOINT // The server endpoint does the redirect
  }
</script>
```


## 2. Create Request URL

*The [`@hellocoop/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/nextjs) npm package has a `createAuthRequest()` function that simplifies creating an authorization request URL, including the PKCE code_verifier and code_challenge*

The **request URL** is `https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize` and a query with the following standard [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) parameters:

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|`client_id`|The `client_id` for your app from [console.hello.coop](https://console.hello.coop) |
|`redirect_uri`|One of the redirect_uri values you registered for your app |
|`scope`|The `openid` scope and zero or more scopes listed at [Hellō Claims](/docs/scopes)|
|`nonce`|A unique string that will be included in the signed ID Token. This links the ID Token to your request|
|`response_type` (optional)| `id_token` flow or<br/><span>`code` flow (default and recommended, but requires [PKCE - RFC7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html)).</span> |
|`response_mode` (optional)|if `id_token` flow `fragment` or `form_post` (default) <br/>if `code` flow `fragment`, `form_post`, or `query` (default)|
|`state` (optional)|A value representing the state of your application that will be returned as a parameter in the response|
|`code_challenge`|REQUIRED if `code` flow and not using a client secret to authenticate to the token endpoint.|
|`code_challenge_method`|May be provided if `code_challenge` is included.<br/>MUST have value of `S256`|

### PKCE Code

> [RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) *(Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients)* enables your application to prove it made the authorization request that received the authorization code when it calls the token endpoint. 
>
>
> This is done by generating a random `code_verifier` and then a `code_challenge` which is a SHA256 cryptographic hash `code_verifier`.
>
>
>The `code_challenge` is part of the authorization request, and the `code_verifier` is presented with the `code` to Hellō which verifies the `code` was requested with the `code_challenge`. This allows an application to not have to manage a client secret when using a `code` flow.


**Here is a sample `id_token` flow request from the[ GreenfieldDemo](https://greenfielddemo.com) app**<br/>
*(line feeds added for readability)*

```http
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?client_id=3574f001-0874-4b20-bffd-8f3e37634274
&redirect_uri=https://greenfielddemo.com/
&scope=name+nickname+email+picture+openid
&nonce=b957cea0-f159-4390-ba48-5c5d7e943ea4
&response_mode=fragment
```

**Here is a sample `code` flow request from the[ Hellō Next.js Starter](https://hello-nextjs-starter.vercel.app/) app**<br/>
*(line feeds added for readability)*

```http
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?client_id=db4ad0b8-c589-4328-8094-f2d0e2cd3aaa
&redirect_uri=https://hello-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/api/hellocoop
&scope=openid+name+email+picture
&nonce=ecc855c9-41e3-46a0-a99a-d1fa3e3c1d3f
&response_type=code
&response_mode=query
&code_challenge=F_xW4_XNddm_XXZgMQAnHBWZRAtc3ZXxb-kcL_rvDns
&code_challenge_method=S256
```

### Advanced Features
See the [Authorization Request](/docs/oidc/request) reference for additional functionality including how to change the recommended providers.

## 3. Make Request

Cause the user's browser to load the `request URL` you created in `Step 2`. Here are some examples:
- Set `window.location.href` with JavaScript
```javascript
window.location.href = "https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize?..."
```
- An `<a>` tag with an `href` to the `requestURL`
```html
<a href="https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize?..." /> ... </a>
```
- HTTP 302 redirect from the server
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize?...
```

The user will then interact with Hellō. When finished they will be redirected back to your application with either an ID Token, an authorization code, or an error response.

## 4. Receive Response

If the user consents to your request, you will receive either a `code` or an `id_token` based on the value you set in `response_type`. If an error occurred, you will receive an `error` parameter instead. See the [Error](/docs/apis/errors) section of API reference for error response details.

How you receive the response is determined by the value of `response_mode`:

### `query`

This `response_mode` is only for the `code` flow. Not allowing `id_token` prevents the token and associated PII from being in web server logs.

Sample Node.js code for getting code (or possible error)
```javascript
const { code, error } = req.query
if (error)
  // process error
if (code)
  // exchange code for id_token - see below
```

### `fragment`

This `response_mode` is for client side processing of the response such as a single page app as the the fragment is only available to the browser. 

The following sample JavaScript will acquire the `id_token` from the fragment

```javascript
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.substring(1))
const id_token = params.get('id_token') // eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1...rest_of_ID_Token
```

### `form_post`

To provide this `response_mode`, Hellō sends a page to the browser that contains JavaScript that posts the response to the `redirect_uri`. Note this is NOT a JSON object, but has `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Sample Node.js code for getting code (or possible error)
```javascript
const { code, error } = req.body
if (error)
  // process error
if (code)
  // exchange code for id_token - see below
```

## 5. Process Response

Both the `code` and `id_token` responses require further processing to complete authenticating your user. 

### `code`

You retrieve the ID Token for the user by doing an HTTP `POST` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `https://wallet.hello.coop/oauth/token` with the `client_id`,`code`, and `redirect_uri` parameters. If using PKCE, then the `code_verifier` is also included. Otherwise the `client_secret` is passed.

**Sample code to call token endpoint**

```javascript
const url = 'https://wallet.hello.coop/oauth/token'
const params = {
  client_id,    // your apps client_id
  code,         // the authorization code your received
  redirect_uri, // the redirect_uri you used when making the request
  code_verifier // the code_verifier used to generate the code_challenge

}
const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    mode: 'cors',
    cache: 'no-cache',
    headers: {'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    body: new URLSearchParams(params).toString()
}
const response = await fetch(url, options)
const { id_token, error } = await response.json()
```

Assuming no errors, you now have an ID Token in compact JWT format.

There is no requirement to validate the ID Token returned from the token endpoint as your application received it directly from Hellō. Of course, if your application provides the ID Token to another system, then it can independently verify the token.

You will need to parse the ID Token to access the user info contained. See the [ID Token](#6-id-token) section for details on the contents of an ID Token. 

The `@hellocoop/core` Node.js SDK provides the `parseToken()` helper function to parse the ID Token for you.

### `id_token`

Your application has an ID Token for the user, but before using it, you need to ensure it is valid, and not an ID Token an attacker has passed to your application.

You can validate the `id_token` by:
1. Sending it back to the Hellō introspection API; or
2. Perform validation yourself per [OpenID Connect 3.1.3.7](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation)


#### Hellō Introspection API

Hellō provides an introspection API per [RFC 7662](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7662.html) at`https://wallet.hello.coop/oauth/introspect` that will examine the token, ensure it was from Hellō, has not expired, and return the payload.

No authentication is required to call the introspection endpoint. You MUST pass your `client_id`, and if you provided a `nonce` in the `request URL`, you MUST provide the nonce. The `token`, `client_id`, and optional `nonce` are sent as JSON.


**Sample code to make Introspection API call**

```javascript
const url = 'https://wallet.hello.coop/oauth/introspect'
const params = {
  token,        // the ID Token received
  client_id,    // your apps client_id
  nonce,        // the nonce sent in the request
}
const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    mode: 'cors',
    cache: 'no-cache',
    headers: {'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    body: new URLSearchParams(params).toString()
}
const response = await fetch(url, options)
const json = await response.json()
```

### Introspection Response

If successfully validated, you will receive the ID Token payload with `active:true` to indicate it is an active token. If unsuccessful, you will receive an [Introspection Error](/docs/apis/errors).

**Sample Introspection Response**

```json
{
  "iss": "https://issuer.hello.coop",
  "aud": "3574f001-0874-4b20-bffd-8f3e37634274",
  "nonce": "b957cea0-f159-4390-ba48-5c5d7e943ea4",
  "jti": "8ad167d1-d170-46c9-b3c6-47dda735a4e3",
  "sub": "f9e21f0f-9f0e-41b0-a58b-c2d63bcc7b4f",
  "scope": [
      "name",
      "nickname",
      "picture",
      "email",
      "openid"
  ],
  "name": "Dick Hardt",
  "nickname": "Dick",
  "picture": "https://cdn.hello.coop/images/default-picture.png",
  "email": "dick.hardt@hello.coop",
  "email_verified": true,
  "iat": 1669399110,
  "exp": 1669399410,
  "active": true
}
```

#### Self Validation

There are many OpenID Connect and JSON Web Token libraries that include ID Token validation. The OpenID Foundation maintains a list [here](https://openid.net/developers/libraries/). Getting security right is HARD. We recommend you use a proven library and NOT write your own validation. We include the information below for reference.

#### Signature Verification Keys

Hellō provides OpenId Provider configuration information per [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) at:

[`https://issuer.hello.coop/.well-known/openid-configuration`](https://issuer.hello.coop/.well-known/openid-configuration)

The `jwks_uri` property in the configuration file contains the URI for a JSON file containing the public keys in JSON Web Key format ([RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517)) for verifying the signature per step (6) above.

#### Signature Verification Steps

Following are details for each ID Token validation step per [OpenID Connect 3.1.3.7](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation)

1. N/A - The ID Token is not encrypted
1. The `iss` value MUST be `https://issuer.hello.coop`
1. The `aud` value MUST be the `client_id` value provided in the request
1. N/A - The ID Token will not contain multiple audiences
1. There will not be an `azp` claim
1. The ID Token is signed per JWS. The certificates are XXX
1. The `alg` value will be `RS256`
1. N/A - the `alg` is always `RS256`
1. The current time must be before `exp`. Note the time is seconds since the Epoch, not milliseconds. ID Tokens expire after one hour.
1. The `iat` may be used by the client if the one hour expiry is longer than is desirable by the client.
1. The `nonce` is included if provided in the request.
1. The `acr` Claim is not supported at this time.
1. The `auth_time` Claim is not supported at this time.



## 6. ID Token

An ID Token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html) that has claims per [OpenID Connect §2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken).<br/>In the following example of a raw ID Token:
- <span style={{color: "#b392f0"}}>`purple`</span> is the **header** that describes the JWT;
- <span style={{color: "#ffea7f"}}>`yellow`</span> is the **payload** of the ID Token; and
- <span style={{color: "#34d058"}}>`green`</span> is the **signature** of the JWT.

**Example ID Token**
