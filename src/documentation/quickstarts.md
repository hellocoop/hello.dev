# Hellō Quickstarts

Want to get something up and running quickly? Our Quickstarts don't require you to understand OAuth or OpenID Connect, nor do they require any manual configuration. You can literally be up and running in seconds.

## Next.js Starter

The [Hellō Next.js Starter](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello-nextjs-starter) demonstrates how to use the [`@hellocoop/nextjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/nextjs) package. 
In less than a minute you will have the starter app running on your local machine -- a minute later you can have it deployed to Vercel. 
You will have access to all the Hellō login options including Apple, Facebook, Google, GitHub, GitLab, and Microsoft. See deployed versions at [https://hello-nextjs-starter.vercel.app/](https://hello-nextjs-starter.vercel.app/) and [https://hello-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/](https://hello-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/).

## WordPress

The [Hellō Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-login/) WordPress Plugin will add all the top social providers to your WordPress site in less than 20 seconds. [See how easy it is to setup](https://blog.hello.coop/2023/07/hello-login-installation-and-comparison-video/). 

## Quickstart Your App

Are you building a starter app that requires auth for other developers? Not only is Hellō easy for you to add, you can use either the Quickstart API or SDK to remove manual configuration. Have a suggestion or a question. File a [Quickstart issue](https://github.com/hellocoop/quickstart/issues).

On our Roadmap we have `express`, `fastify`, `react`, `Svelte`, `SvelteKit`. Let us know what else you would like in [discussion](https://github.com/hellocoop/hello.dev/discussions/53).
