# Pricing

<div id="pricing">
<!-- Pricing should be below this -->

Using Hellō for log in will always be free. There is no MAU (Monthly Active User) fee.

Hellō verified claims are currently free, and will continue to be free until the co-operative board decides Hellō has reached a critical mass of adoption. Early adopters of Hellō will be rewarded to minimize or eliminate paying to use Hellō.

The Hellō business model is to charge an interchange fee of a few pennies for each new verified claim a user releases to an application, similar to the fee a service such as Twilio charges for verifying an email address or phone number.

Hellō will acquire verified claims that are free and can be obtained by the user linking providers. Only the interchange fee will be charged for these claims. Hh will operate a marketplace for vendors of verified claims to sell their claims to Hellō developers. Vendors will set the price for their claims, and Hellō will charge an interchange fee.
