# OpenID Connect

Hellō, specifically, the Hellō Wallet, is an implementation of [OpenID Connect (opens in a new tab)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), the same identity federation protocol used by Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.

The section of the documentation describes Hellō implementation of OpenID Connect. Hellō extensions are documented in [API Reference | Wallet](/docs/apis/wallet/) and the support scope values in [Hellō Scopes](/docs/scopes/).

The Hellō OpenID Configuration is at [https://issuer.hello.coop/.well-known/openid-configuration (opens in a new tab)](https://issuer.hello.coop/.well-known/openid-configuration).

NOTE: The Hellō Issuer is `https://issuer.hello.coop` and is NOT `https://wallet.hello.coop`. This simplifies a separation of concerns per the Hellō Protocol
