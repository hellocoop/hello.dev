# UX Reference

## Buttons

You can [style your buttons](./getting-started#3-custom-button-label), or use the [standard, Hellō styled buttons](./getting-started#2-standard-hellō-buttons) that include a button explorer to show the different styles, hover effects, and locales.

Use these style classes to customize the appearance of your buttons for different design scenarios.

| Button style classes           | Description                                             | 
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | 
| `.hello-btn-black-on-dark`     | Black button with dark borders for dark backgrounds                       | 
| `.hello-btn-black-and-invert`  | Dynamic black/gray button for light and dark themes     |
| `.hello-btn-black-and-static`  | Black button with a dark border on dark theme, and without a border on a light theme              |
| `.hello-btn-white-on-light`    | White button with dark border for light and dark themes |
| `.hello-btn-white-on-dark`     | Gray button for both light and dark themes              |
| `.hello-btn-white-and-invert`  | Dynamic white/black button with dark borders for light and dark themes |
| `.hello-btn-white-and-static`  | White button with dark border on light theme, gray button on dark theme  |

Enhance user experience by adding interactive hover effects to your buttons.

| Hover style classes     | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.hello-btn-hover-glow` | Subtle glowing effect on hover         |
| `.hello-btn-hover-flare`| Captivating flare effect when hovered over |
| `.hello-btn-hover-none` | No hover effect applied                        |

Clearly indicate when buttons are in a loading state with a spinner for a user-friendly experience.

| Button state classes    | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.hello-btn-loader`     | Adds a loading spinner respecting button style and hover classes         |

## Logos

The Hellō Wallet is a theme aware web application. Depending on your logo, you may want to provide both a light and dark themed logo for Hellō to present to your users. The [Hellō Developer Console](https://console.hello.coop/) gives you a preview of what the user will be presented with.

Hellō does not force an aspect ratio of your logo in the consent page. The maximum display area is 160px x 64px. We will scale your logo to fit in that display area. Your file can be up to 150kB and we support .png, lgif, .jpg/.jpeg, .webp, and .apng formats.


## Provider Hint

When Hellō does not know the user's preferred provider (new user or new browser), they are presented with a recommended list of providers to choose from, with the option to show all the other supported providers. This minimizes the risk that a new user is overwhelmed by all the available options, while still providing choice.

You can change which providers are recommended to better align with your users' preferences by passing a `provider_hint` query parameter in your authorization request.  You add providers by providing one or more space (or `+` in URL) separated slugs: 

```http {3}
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=discord+github
```

You can demote a default provider by suffixing the slug with `--`.

```http /google--/
https://wallet.hello.coop/authorize
?{...}
&provider_hint=google--
```

**Provider Defaults** 

| Platform     | Default provider_hint values  |
| -----------  | ----------------------------- |
| Default      | `google email passkey¹`       |
| macOS/iOS    | `apple google email passkey¹` |
| Windows      | `microsoft google email`      |

¹ Mobile devices where passkey is supported

**Possible slug values**

`apple google discord facebook github gitlab`<br/>
` twitch twitter tumblr mastodon microsoft line qrcode wordpress yahoo `<br/>
`email phone ethereum passkey`
